# AI-JobMatcher

## Overview
The **AI-Resume-Screener** is an intelligent system designed to automatically evaluate and classify resumes based on job descriptions. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques such as **TF-IDF, BERT embeddings, and XGBoost**, this tool efficiently ranks resumes for better candidate selection. The project also features a **FastAPI-based interface** for easy resume uploading and evaluation.

## Key Features
âœ… **Resume Parsing** â€“ Extracts text from resumes in PDF and DOCX formats.  
âœ… **TF-IDF & BERT-based Matching** â€“ Compares resumes with job descriptions for relevance.  
âœ… **Skill Matching** â€“ Identifies and scores skills based on predefined job requirements.  
âœ… **Suitability Prediction** â€“ Uses an XGBoost model to predict the best candidates.  
âœ… **FastAPI Integration** â€“ Provides a user-friendly API for uploading and processing resumes.  
âœ… **Automated Ranking** â€“ Assigns scores to resumes based on similarity and skills match.

## Installation & Setup
### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate on Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Activate on macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download Necessary NLP Models
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Step 4: Run the FastAPI Server
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
ðŸ“Œ The server will run at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### Step 5: Access API Documentation
Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for an interactive API testing interface.

## How It Works
1. **Upload resumes** â€“ The system extracts text using `pdfplumber` and `python-docx`.
2. **Process job descriptions** â€“ Extracts keywords using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings.
3. **Analyze skill match** â€“ Identifies relevant skills in the resume.
4. **Predict suitability** â€“ The XGBoost model assigns scores to resumes.
5. **Return ranked candidates** â€“ The system provides a sorted list based on job relevance.

## Future Enhancements
ðŸš€ **Expand support for more resume formats** (CSV, JSON).  
ðŸš€ **Improve accuracy using transformer-based models** like RoBERTa.  
ðŸš€ **Add a web-based frontend for easy interaction**.
